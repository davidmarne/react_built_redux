### react_built_redux

offers a provider component and a connect function for built_redux and react-dart

### Caution
This library is built on a branch of [react-dart] that supports react's context api.
This branch is not merged or released, therefore I will not release this library until it is merged into [react-dart].
Use of this library should only be for experimentation until [react-dart] officially supports react's context api.
